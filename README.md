all i wanted was a simple static dev server that i could have livereload on,
and not have to futz around with a lot of grunt/gulp/webpack etc.etc. ad nauseam
(forever... ugh).

so after a little trouble, i figured this configuration out. here it is for anyone
to use.

maybe it's basic, i dunno. i think i learned some in tossing it together.
