    all i wanted was a simple static dev server that i could have livereload on,
    and not have to futz around with alot of grunt/gulp/webpack etc.etc. ad nauseam
    (forever... ugh).

    so after a little trouble, i figured this configuration out. here it is for anyone
    to use.

    maybe it's basic, i dunno. i think i learned some in tossing it together.
